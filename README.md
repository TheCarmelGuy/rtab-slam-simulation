# Description 

This Project corespoinds to the Localization project for the udacity robotic software engineering course. This consists of  the following feaures:

- Simple differential-modeled robot using ROS conrol package
- Adaptive Mote Carlo Localization which uses hokuyo scanner and odometry information for localization
- Both a teleoperation node and a planning node to move the bot to locations designated by the user. 

Screenshots of the bot localizing in Rviz can be seen in screenshots. "initial_position.png" shows the original uncertainty and pose estimate of the bot and "localized_bot.png" shows the bot after some time after properly localizing. Notice the decrease in the particle spread between the two.

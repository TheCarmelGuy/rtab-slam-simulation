# Description 

This Project corespoinds to the Localization project for the udacity robotic software engineering course. This consists of  the following feaures:

- Simple differential-modeled robot using ROS conrol package
- Adaptive Mote Carlo Localization which uses hokuyo scanner and odometry information for localization
- Both a teleoperation node and a planning node to move the bot to locations designated by the user. 

Screenshots of the bot localizing in Rviz can be seen in amcl_screenshots
